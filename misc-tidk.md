# Things I don't know

Inspired by [overreacted](https://overreacted.io/things-i-dont-know-as-of-2018/)

- Non-trivial bash scripting. Commands such as `xargs` are complete mystery to me. I can't remember how to write most of the conditionals, I have to google it every time.
- Low-level languages : I once wrote Assembly (which flavor ?) in school, like 15 years ago.
- Networking : I know the big picture, but most of the protocols are complete black boxes to me. I collapse in tears every time I have to configure anything related to networking.
- AWS / Azure : I played a bit with both, I vaguely know how to start a docker container, and configure properties or fire basic services, but that's all.
- Kubernetes, Terraform : I probably can fix a typo in it, but that's all.
- Python : I wrote my first non-trivial script one week ago.
- Perl : Never used it.
- Ruby : I used it for some helper scripts around, but I constantly have to google for loops, classes, and such
- Modern Javascript : I used to be fluent in JS dev during the JQuery / AngularJS (aka. Angular 1) ages, but I completely lost it. Webpack, Vue, React, etc : I played a bit with all those, I'm not convinced, and I can't spend time learning new framework / toolchain every 6 months.
- Maths : I suck at it.
- CSS : Float is a mystery to me. Heard about flexbox and grid but never tried them.
